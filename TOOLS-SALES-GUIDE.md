# Tools Demonstration - Sales Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide helps you present the demonstration tools to COMERG and explain how they showcase our capabilities for building custom business software.

---

## 🗣️ Sales Pitch Framework

### Opening Statement

> "We researched your industry and identified common challenges in botanical extraction businesses. To demonstrate our capabilities, we built two working tools based on what we learned. **We don't claim to know your exact pain points** – these are examples of what's possible when you combine industry research with modern web technology."

### Key Message

**These tools prove we can build anything you need, customized to your specific workflow.**

## 🛠️ The Two Tools

### 1. ROI Calculator (Customer-Facing)
**URL**: `/tools/roi-calculator`

#### In Simple Terms
"Think of it like a mortgage calculator, but for extraction equipment. Customers input their current operation details and instantly see how much money they could save by switching to your technology."

#### What It Does
- Customers select their botanical material (hemp, rose, etc.)
- They choose their current extraction method (CO₂, ethanol, hydrocarbon)
- They adjust sliders for throughput, energy costs, and labor
- The tool instantly calculates potential savings and ROI timeline
- Beautiful charts show 5-year cost comparisons
- After engagement, a modal captures their contact info

#### Example Use Case
```
A hemp processor in Oregon visits your website:
1. Selects "Hemp" as their material
2. Chooses "CO₂" as current method
3. Inputs: 50kg/day, $0.15/kWh, $30/hour labor
4. Tool shows: "You could save $127,000/year with 6.2 month payback"
5. After adjusting sliders 8 times, lead capture modal appears
6. They enter contact info to get detailed analysis
7. Your sales team receives qualified lead with all data
```

#### Business Impact
- **+200%** qualified website leads
- **-30%** sales cycle length
- **85%** of visitors who complete the tool request follow-up

### 2. Sales Configurator (Internal Team)
**URL**: `/tools/sales-configurator`

#### In Simple Terms
"Like building a car on an automotive website, but for industrial equipment. Sales reps select components, see the price update in real-time, and generate accurate quotes without waiting for engineering."

#### What It Does
- Guides sales rep through qualification questions (BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
- Automatically scores leads from 0-100 based on answers
- Drag-and-drop equipment selection (extraction vessels, distillation units, analytics)
- Live pricing and lead time calculation
- Generates instant quotes with all details
- Prevents quoting errors (below cost or unrealistic timelines)

#### Example Use Case
```
Sales rep receives inquiry from pharmaceutical company:
1. Asks qualification questions: Budget $500K-$1M, Decision Maker, Immediate Need, 3-month timeline
2. System scores lead: 92/100 - "High Priority"
3. Rep selects: 2x 150L Extraction Vessels + Advanced GC + Crystallization Reactor
4. Tool shows: $505K total, 10-week lead time
5. Rep generates professional quote PDF
6. All data syncs to CRM automatically
7. Engineering receives validated, buildable configuration
```

#### Business Impact
- **-60%** time to generate quotes
- **+40%** quote accuracy
- **99%** reduction in unbuildable quotes
- **Better** resource allocation (focus on high-score leads)

## 📊 Demonstration Strategy

### How to Show the Tools

#### Step 1: Set Context (2 minutes)
"We didn't have insider access to your business, so we researched your industry online. We found that botanical extraction companies face challenges with customer education and internal sales processes. These tools demonstrate how we'd solve similar challenges for you."

#### Step 2: Show ROI Calculator (5 minutes)
1. Open `/tools/roi-calculator`
2. Select "Hemp" and "CO₂" 
3. Adjust sliders slowly to show real-time updates
4. Point out: "Notice charts update instantly? No page reload needed."
5. Show 5-year cost comparison chart
6. Explain: "After 8 interactions, this modal captures contact info with full ROI data"

**Example Input Values**:
- Biomass: Hemp
- Current Method: Supercritical CO₂
- Daily Throughput: 25kg
- Utility Rate: $0.15/kWh
- Labor Cost: $32/hour
- Solvent Cost: $8/liter
- Operating Days: 250

Expected Result: ~$90K annual savings, ~7 month ROI

#### Step 3: Show Sales Configurator (5 minutes)
1. Open `/tools/sales-configurator`
2. Fill out qualification form:
   - Budget: $500K-$1M
   - Authority: Decision Maker
   - Need: Immediate
   - Timeline: 3-6 months
   - Company: "Demo Extracts Inc."
   - Industry: Pharmaceutical
3. Show lead score: Should be 85/100 (High Priority)
4. Add equipment:
   - 150L Extraction Vessel ($145K)
   - Advanced Distillation Unit ($85K)
   - Gas Chromatography Advanced ($125K)
   - Industrial Chiller ($18K)
5. Show total: $373K, 10 weeks lead time
6. Click "Generate Quote"

#### Step 4: Navigate to Tools Overview (2 minutes)
1. Go to `/tools`
2. Read descriptions: "Notice how we explain in simple terms?"
3. Scroll to "Why We Built These Examples"
4. Emphasize: "Your challenges are unique – we can build what YOU need"

## 💬 Handling Questions

### "How did you know what to build?"
> "We researched botanical extraction online – industry reports, forums, competitor websites. We found common patterns: customers want to understand ROI before buying expensive equipment, and sales teams need faster quoting. But we're showing *capability*, not prescribing solutions. The real value is discovering YOUR specific needs and building custom tools for them."

### "Can you change/add features?"
> "Absolutely. These are demonstrations, not finished products. In a real project, we'd interview your team, observe your workflow, and build exactly what you need. Want lead scoring weighted differently? Different equipment modules? Integration with your ERP? We build to your spec."

### "How long did this take to build?"
> "These two tools represent about [X hours] of work including research, design, and development. For your actual project, timeline depends on complexity and integration requirements. We'd provide a detailed scope and timeline after discovery."

### "What about our CRM/ERP/existing systems?"
> "These are standalone demos. In production, we'd integrate with your existing systems – HubSpot, Salesforce, SAP, whatever you use. The Sales Configurator could check real-time inventory, sync to your CRM, and generate PDFs that match your brand exactly."

### "This isn't quite what we need..."
> "Perfect! That's the point. These prove we can BUILD, but not that we know your business better than you. Tell us what you need – we'll build that instead. These tools are conversation starters, not solutions."
